    "Summary": "This is a direct amendment to Title IX. This bill directs all schools that receive Federal funding to classify all sports teams and athletic programs/activities as being for \"males, men, or boys\", \"females, women, or girls\". It bans students whose \"biological sex\" is male from participating in sports teams designated for females, women, or girls. According to this bill, \"biological sex\" is defined by a persons reproductive biology and genetics at birth. Given essentially nobody has a genetic test done at birth, in practice this means the basis would be entirely on what sex a person was assigned at birth. Students can sue the educational institution with claims they were harmed or lost some athletic opportunity as a result of a violation of this bill. Additionally it calls for a study to be done to document all complaints made against trans students in girls sports, to be submitted to congress. ",

Medical professionals who violate this prohibition will be fined and/or imprisoned for up to 12 years. This bill also prevents federal funds from being used to provide gender-affirming care to anyone including adults, and it prevents federal funds from being used for health insurance coverage that includes gender-affirming care. Gender-affirming care cannot be provided by a health care service owned or operated by the federal government or on federal land, in a federal territory, or on tribal lands, or by medical professionals funded by or working for the federal government. Tax credits and cost-sharing assistance under the Affordable Care Act may not be used for plans that cover gender-affirming care, and small employers may not receive a credit for their contributions to employee health care plans that cover gender-affirming care. Institutions of higher education that receive federal funds may not provide instruction in gender-affirming care, and accrediting agencies may not accredit institutions of higher education that do so. People from other countries who are found to have provided gender-affirming care to minors are ineligible for visas or admission to the U.S., and if they are already here it is grounds for deportation.",

People who claim harm from violations of this act can seek remedy under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Employees can also bring a civil action in response to violations. Retaliation against people who make a complaint or bring a lawsuit, or testify or assist in one, is prohibited.",
