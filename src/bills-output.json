    "Summary": "This bill prohibits school and public libraries from keeping material that is considered \"harmful to minors\" within their collection. Material is considered \"harmful to minors\" if the average person would consider that it appeals to a prurient interest and if it is devoted to or principally consists of descriptions of real, simulated, or animated sexual acts or nudity, and if it lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. This could be extended to apply to queer and trans content. Additionally, a clause is added to the definition of \"sexual conduct\" that defines any \"knowing expos[ure]\" to \"sexual or gender oriented conduct\" alongside language typically used to refer to Drag performances. Thus, the bill is significantly expanding what is not allowed in K-12 public schools and libraries. It then proceeds to remove the existing immunity to criminal prosecution for public schools/libraries under obscenity laws, even when acting on behalf of genuine educational purpose, should they fail to remove the content fast enough. Specifically, if a parent has provided written notice asking for the removal of something from the collection, it must be removed/relocated within 15-25 days (depending on circumstance). Violations of this law make the entity liable for potential criminal charges, damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.",

The bill defines a \"female\" as someone with the reproductive organs to produce an egg and a \"male\" as someone with the reproductive organs to produce sperm. This bill restricts the ability of governmental programs to collect SOGI data. This inhibits the ability to collect vital statistics, which are used to curate programs that provide essential support for queer youth. Without these anonymous surveys, such programs are at serious risk for budget cuts, since without proof of existence queer youth are assumed to not exist. Schools, government agencies, and/or state departments that report statistics to the government must identify individuals as \"male\" or \"female.\" If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect.",

The amendments proposed add definitions to \"hormone-repalcement therapy\", \"puberty-blocking medication\" and \"sex reassignment surgery.\". It defines \"sex\" as the biological state of being male or female, in the context of reproductive potential or capacity, based on an individual's sex organs, chromosomes,naturally occurring sex hormones, gonads, and internal and external genitalia present at birth, including secondary sex characteristics. It further repeals an exception to the law for the continued treatment of minors who were being treated with hormone therapy prior to July 1, 2023. ",

    "Summary": "This bill establishes a council to oversee school library content, defining \"harmful to minors\" materials and requiring parental consent for certain materials. It mandates annual reviews of instructional materials and parental notification, with a formal complaint process for contested content. This bill reforms sex education, replacing the current curriculum with an abstinence-based model that bans discussions on gender identity and sexual orientation before 6th grade. Parents must additionally opt their children in to sex education in writing (instead of opting out). Additionally, schools must publish curricula and allow parents to withdraw consent at any time. This bill requires any public or private school employee to inform the legal guardians of a minor if that minor's gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth. It also mandates that school employees are not allowed to encourage any minor to keep their gender identity private rather than telling their legal guardians. This bill prohibits public school employees from using pronouns or names for students that differ from the student's \"biological sex\" unless the school or school board receives written permission from the student's parent. Public school teachers are never required to use a student's preferred pronoun. It also establishes guidelines for parental involvement in decisions regarding their child's health, requiring schools to notify parents and provide consent forms for health services. The bill ensures these provisions apply statewide, including to charter and special schools. If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect. This bill goes into effect immediately upon signing.",

In doing so, it would require the repealing of the Equitable Restrooms Act and redefining the Human Rights Act. The bill would require all Illinois-issued identification documents to reflect the holder's sex. Female is defined by the \"large reproductive cell\" that is produced \"at conception\"; male is defined by the \"small reproductive cell\" that is produced \"at conception.\". This bill also requires the Department of Human Rights to issue guidance to \"ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex space in workplaces.\" It also requires updates to forms, communications, and the prioritization of investigations and litigation to enforce the act.

    "Summary": "This bill is an attempt to codify the definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" in the state's general statutes, explicitly amending other components of state law with this included definitions. It states that a person's sex is determined by their reproductive role, chromosomes, genitalia, and capacity to produce sperm or ova or their theoretical capacity to do so, and that sex is determined at birth and cannot be changed. The bill defines a \"female\" as someone with the reproductive organs to produce an egg and a \"male\" as someone with the reproductive organs to produce sperm. This bill states that any university, private or public, reserved for women or men exclusively, private or public, including universities and other adult education programs, must be exclusive to persons of a particular legal gender marker on their original birth certificate. This bill requires death and marriage certificates, driver's licenses, and various court and police records to have a \"biological sex\" designation. Sleeping quarters may only be designated for one sex in the context of K-12 school trips unless parental permission is obtained. Additionally, it prohibits people from entering bathrooms and changing rooms that do not correspond to their sex assigned at birth in public buildings. If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect. This bill goes into effect immediately upon signing.",

This includes a written document that must be provided to any minor who requests gender affirming care that includes statements like \"No reliable studies have shown that these treatments reduce the risk of suicide in children or adolescents with gender dysphoria.\" The bill will also require any gender clinic to provide statistical data which will be available of the state's website on all gender affirming treatment it provides. The bill then requires insurance policies that cover gender affirming care to provide coverage for detransition-related care. Along with this care, the insurance provider must also produce statistical reporting on the number of detransition-related care services it covers. Next, the bill requires a new, expedited process to allow an individual to revert back to their deadname. This requires the state to maintain a record of original birth certifiates in order to quickly allow the individual to revert back. This is concerning for trans individuals as there would be a record in their state documents of a change to name/gender.

It mandates that no person shall be allowed to provide, prescribe, or refer treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill also specifically allows for \"corrective\" procedures for intersex traits.

It also mandates that school employees are not allowed to encourage any minor to keep their gender identity private rather than telling their legal guardians.

    "Summary": "This bill modifies existing laws around custody proceedings in the state, stating that a parent's approval or disapproval of a child's gender identity cannot be considered as a factor in determining whether a child should be removed from parental custody by the Division of Children and Family Services, or when determining child custody as part of a divorce or family law proceeding. This bill would prevent the state from prohibiting adoption or foster care services from discriminating against potential parents so long as they do so in line with a \"sincerely held religious belief\". This bill states that an adoptive or foster parent's \"sincerely held religious or moral belief\" regarding sexual orientation or gender identity may not have any bearing on consideration for the placement of a child. The effects of this bill could endanger trans children in the foster system by placing them with parents who deny their identity. This bill allows discrimination by people, companies, and organizations if it is prompted by \"sincerely held religious belief.\" The bill specifically allows discrimination based in \"belief about biological sex or marriage,\" including which genders should be allowed to get married. This discrimination can only be infringed on if doing so is essential to further a compelling government interest, and if so, it must be accomplished in the least restrictive manner possible. Some examples: Religious organizations can discriminate in hiring, in renting or selling property, and in placing children in adoptive or foster families; individuals can refuse to provide services for certain individuals, including providing services for weddings such as floral arrangements and photography; organizations can establish separate dress codes, bathrooms, etc., based on sex, and state employees can refuse to issue marriage licenses or solemnize marriages to certain people. State government cannot refuse to consider people, organizations, or companies for grants or contracts on the basis of this discrimination, or refuse to provide them with professional licenses or degrees, among other restrictions. A person, company, or organization can assert a violation of these provisions as a claim or defense against state government in judicial or administrative proceedings. ",

These institutions may not abridge the expression of members of the campus community except as permitted by the First Amendment and the Arkansas Constitution. Institutions may still impose some restrictions, such as enforcing policies upholding federal and state anti-harassment and antidiscrimination laws, and prohibiting disruption of scheduled events. Institutions may restrict the time, place, and manner of expression as long as the restriction is reasonable, is narrowly tailored to serve a significant state interest, is not based on the speaker's beliefs, and leaves open ample alternative channels of expression.",

    "Summary": "This bill bans all medical care done for transition purposes for minors unless two independent healthcare providers have documented that a minor's perception of their own gender does not align with their gender assigned at birth over the course of two years. If this requirement is not met, it mandates that no physician or other health care professional shall be allowed to provide, prescribe, or refer treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill specifically excludes treatment for people with intersex traits. Other exceptions include injuries, illness, or when there is an imminent danger of death without treatment. After two years of documentation of a minor's gender dysphoria, gender affirming treatment may be started if the legal guardian and the minor consent. 30 days before they begin and for the first six months of the gender-affirming treatment during every treatment, the minor and their legal guardian have to receive a verbal and written notice stating risks of transition-related care which according to this bill also include that the treatment might worsen the minor's condition, that (mental) health benefits are not proven, and that the risk of suicide due to gender dysphoria is not as high as they might believe.",

    "Summary": "This bill, known as the \"LEARNS Act,\" changes significant aspects of primary and secondary school education. The bill adds a definition of \"prohibited indoctrination,\" which is defined as someone representing a school--an employee, administrator, or guest speaker--communicating in such a way \"that compels a person to adopt, affirm, or profess an idea in violation of Title IV and Title VI,\" which the bill uses to argue against discussing how anyone from a protected category (race, sex, class, etc) is superior or inferior to someone from another protected class. The bill also includes a prohibition on requiring public school employees or students from attending training that involves this \"prohibited indoctrination\". In addition, in the context of establishing a section about child abuse and human trafficking, this bill gives parents the right to review materials before classroom instruction, and prohibits public school teachers from teaching about gender identity or sexual orientation to students before grade 5. The bill would also change other aspects, such as no longer requiring youth mental health first aid for police \"resource officers\" in public schools.",

It states that a person's sex is determined by their chromosomes, hormone levels, and genitalia and that sex is determined at birth and cannot be changed.

Teaching about orientation or gender identity is banned until the 9th grade. All relevant instructional materials and any materials objected to by a parent or resident must be approved by the Board of Education.",

This Bill specifies it would apply to any child \"present\" in the state, so visiting families would also possibly be targeted by this bill. Transition related health care for people above 18 requires documented informed and voluntary consent, something already the medical standard. \n\nThis bill also bans all medical care done for transition purposes for minors (under the age of 18). It mandates that no physician or other health care professional shall be allowed to provide, prescribe, or refer treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill also specifically allows for \"corrective\" procedures for intersex traits. Other exceptions include injuries, illness, or when there is an imminent danger of death without treatment and exceptions can be made for minors that have begun transition-related treatment before this bill went into effect. Violations are considered a first degree misdemeanor.\n\nNotably, this bill would also prevent anyone who is not a licensed physician from being allowed to proscribe gender affirming care for trans adults. This would thus prevent Nurse Practitioners and Physicians Assistants from proscribing care, drastically impacting the amount of adults who are able to get care. This applies to all adults in the state, regardless of age or residency. \n\nThis bill mandates that no health care professional shall be allowed to provide or prescribe treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care or refer minor patients to other providers for transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill specifically allows an exception for \"corrective\" procedures for intersex traits. Violations are considered unprofessional conduct by a medical professional and subject to disciplinary action. This bill also prevents public funds from being given to any organization that provides trans health care to minors in any capacity, and it prevents health insurance companies from paying for trans health care treatments for any minor. It also declares that all money paid to or used for anyone's gender transition may not be tax deductible.

It was amended at the last minute to include an online censorship bill.This bill requires commercial entities that publish material considered \"harmful to minors\" (people under 18) to verify that anyone accessing their site is 18 or older. This requirement would apply if more than one-third of the website's content falls into this category. Material is considered \"harmful to minors\" if the average person would consider that it appeals to a prurient interest and if it is devoted to or principally consists of descriptions of real, simulated, or animated sexual acts or nudity, and if it lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. This could be used to apply to queer and trans content. The commercial entities and any third-party verification services are prohibited from retaining the personal information they collect when verifying users. Violations of this law make the entity liable for damages, injunctive relief, and court costs + attorney's fees. News-gathering organizations and public-interest broadcasts are exempt from this law. This bill also requires parental content before a minor is allowed to hold an account, and restricts data collection on the accounts of minors.",

    "Summary": "This bill is an attempt to codify the definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" in the state's general statutes. It is the first successful rollback of gender identity as a protected class from a state that had previously enshrined protections based on gender identity. It does this by literally striking Gender Identity from Iowa Civil Rights Law.\nAdditionally, this bill states that a person's sex is determined by their reproductive role and capacity to produce sperm or ova or their theoretical capacity to do so, and that sex is determined at birth and cannot be changed. The bill defines a \"female\" as someone with the reproductive organs to produce an egg and a \"male\" as someone with the reproductive organs to produce sperm. It also defined gender as being solely a synonym for \"sex\" and that all references to gender must use the above definition. The bill continues to say that this definition is to be used to discriminate against trans people in all state laws and policies, including documentation. This bill requires birth certificates/records to have a \"sex\" at birth designation that is either male or female, with non-binary designations being banned. Finally, modifies existing educational bans on teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation, calling gender identity gender \"theory\"\nIf any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect.",

The bill requires school districts to guarantee a parent's right to be involved in their child's education and health. This bill also requires the parents or legal guardians to be notified if an employee of the school has reason to believe a student identifies with a gender different from their gender assigned at birth and written consent is necessary to address a student with a name and pronoun not aligning with their birth certificate. An exception is made for emancipated children as well as if the school employee believes that there is a risk of abuse upon learning of the possible transgender identity. Parents must have access to all educational and health records maintained by the school that pertain to their child and be able to remove their child from classes at will, with active notification of any classes pertaining to sexuality and gender identity. Furthermore, this bill prohibits classroom instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation from kindergarten to grade six. This bill removes the requirement to teach about AIDS in grades 1 through 12 and HPV and the available vaccine in grades 7 through 12. Lastly, school library programs may only contain \"age-appropriate\" materials that support the curriculum achievement goals.

    "Summary": "This bill was Heavily amended, read full summary for details.\n\nThis bill initially expands parental authority over their child by requiring that all medical records and all school records must be made available to the parents or legal guardians of a minor (under 18). Schools would not be allowed to make policies to prevent deadnaming or misgendering of students, and would be required to out students to their parents. Schools would also be required to provide descriptions of all mental health services and allow parents to opt their children out. Additionally, schools must gain written permission from parents or legal guardians before teaching students about sex, sexuality, or gender, and give all materials related to classes addressing such subjects to parents for review 14 days in advance.\n\nThis bill was heavily amended last minute in several key ways. First, it prevents teaching about sexuality, gender expression, or gender identity through grades 8, and allows from 9-12 only in extremely limited and approved classes. Any teacher or presenter may not refer to their own gender identity nor sexual orientation, except if that identity is cisgendered and heterosexual. No class may teach in any way about racism, homophobia, transphobia, or any aspect of oppression/bigotry. Any discussion of \"controversial subject matter\" is disallowed, with explicit banning of discussions on non-cisgendered and non-heterosexual positions.\n\nThis bill also bans the showing of nudity and \"obscene\" materials within public schools, defining these in such a way to likely remove most health textbooks, as well as depictions of PRIDE and queer people in general. \n\nAnother section would ban students from using bathrooms based on anything but their birth certificate. The phrasing suggests schools to develop such policies to \"protect privacy\". \n\nFinally, this bill bans all medical care done for transition purposes for minors (under the age of 18). It mandates that no physician or other health care professional shall be allowed to provide, prescribe, or refer treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill also specifically allows for \"corrective\" procedures for intersex traits. Violations are considered unprofessional conduct by a medical professional and subject to disciplinary action. ",

The bill would ban gender transition-related healthcare for minors, and would ban all healthcare providers (including those working in mental health) from referring a minor to a doctor for gender transition-related clinical care. The bill would additionally prohibit the use of public funds for gender transition-related healthcare to minors, insurance companies from covering gender transition-related healthcare for minors, and all state or government healthcare facilities from providing gender transition-related healthcare. Anyone who received clinical care for gender-affirming reasons as a minor can pursue compensation or other damages, with a statute of thirty years after the person turned 18.

    "Summary": "This bill requires commercial entities that publish material considered \"harmful to minors\" (people under 18) to verify that anyone accessing their site is 18 or older. Material is considered \"harmful to minors\" if the average person would consider that it appeals to a prurient interest and if it is devoted to or principally consists of descriptions of real, simulated, or animated sexual acts or nudity, and if it lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. The bill also includes under \"harmful\" content that promotes or facilitates self-harm, violence, or any other illegal activity. This could be used to apply to queer and trans content. There are some limits on retaining and sharing the personal information they collect when verifying users. Violations of this law make the entity liable for injunctive relief, and may only be brought by individual parents on behalf of their minor children. The bill would take effect July 1, 2024.",

    "Summary": "This bill has several components. The first section is a bathroom bill, with the second a full trans erasure bill. \nFirst, this bill is an attempt to codify the definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" in the state's general statutes. It states that a person's sex is determined by their capacity to produce sperm or ova or their theoretical capacity to do so, and that sex is determined at birth and cannot be changed. The bill defines a woman as someone with the reproductive organs to produce an egg  and a man as someone with the reproductive organs to produce sperm. It then applies this definition to any and all state statutes.\nThis bill requires any public building with a bathroom or changing room to have bathrooms and changing facilities designated for exclusive use by females and males along with unisex facilities. The bill also prohibits people from entering bathrooms and changing rooms that do not correspond to their sex assigned at birth in any public building, except for in several predetermined instances: when accompanying a person of the opposite sex to assist them or when chaperoning a child under age 12; for law enforcement or governmental regulatory purposes; when providing emergency medical assistance or intervening in an emergency situation; for custodial maintenance; or if the appropriately designated bathroom or changing facility is out of order and the restroom or changing facility designated for the opposite sex is free of any patrons. In this bill, \"sex\" is defined by the person's genitalia and genetics. If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect. This bill goes into effect immediately upon signing.",

    "Summary": "This bill requires commercial entities that publish material considered \"harmful to minors\" (people under 18) to verify that anyone accessing their site is 18 or older. This requirement would apply if more than one-third of the website's content falls into this category. Material is considered \"harmful to minors\" if the average person would consider that it appeals to a prurient interest and if it is devoted to or principally consists of descriptions of real, simulated, or animated sexual acts or nudity, and if it lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. This could be used to apply to queer and trans content. The commercial entities and any third-party verification services are prohibited from retaining the personal information they collect when verifying users. Violations of this law make the entity liable for damages. News-gathering organizations and public-interest broadcasts are exempt from this law.",

It also requires this for any program on human sexuality or sexual education (topics that were already required to be disclosed if used for instruction but not for a program). No notice is required for a school employee answering a question from a student during class. The bill also removes the phrase \"To the extent practicable\" from a requirement that a school district make curriculum course materials available to parents on request. The bill also prohibits schools from adopting policies preventing school district personnel from notifying a parent about their child's mental, emotional, or physical health or sexuality. School policies also may not encourage a student to withhold this kind of information from their parents, and school employees may not discourage or prohibit parental notification and involvement in decisions affecting their child's mental, emotional, or physical health, except when there is reason to believe that parental notification will put a student at risk of abuse, neglect, or abandonment.",

    "Summary": "This bill requires schools to classify all of their sports as being for \"males, men, or boys\", \"females, women, or girls\", or \"coed or mixed\". It bans athletes whose \"biological sex\" is male from participating in female, women, or girls sports. At the start of each school year, each student who competes on a school athletic team (or their legal guardian if the student is under 18) is required to sign an affidavit acknowledging their \"biological sex\" at birth. It there is any change in the status of the student's \"biological sex\", the student must notify the school within 30 days. This bill does not provide a definition for \"biological sex\" or a protocol for settling disputes. The requirements in this bill apply to athletic teams that are sponsored by a public school, a charter school, an institution in The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education, or a private school whose students compete against a public school. Students can sue the educational institution if they can claim they were harmed or lost some opportunity as a result of violations of this bill.",

    "Summary": "This bill initially appears to be a only ban on child pornography, something that is in no way objectionable. However it was amended in committee to include the provisions below, which extend into online censorship. \nThis bill requires commercial entities that publish material considered \"harmful to minors\" (people under 18) to verify that anyone accessing their site is 18 or older. This requirement would apply if more than one-third of the website's content falls into this category. Material is considered \"harmful to minors\" if the average person would consider that it appeals to a prurient interest and if it is devoted to or principally consists of descriptions of real, simulated, or animated sexual acts or nudity, and if it lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. This could be used to apply to queer and trans content. The commercial entities and any third-party verification services are prohibited from retaining the personal information they collect when verifying users. Violations of this law make the entity liable for damages, injunctive relief, and court costs + attorney's fees. News-gathering organizations and public-interest broadcasts are exempt from this law. If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect. This bill goes into effect immediately upon signing.",

Furthermore, this bill requires any public or private school employees to inform the legal guardians of a minor if that minor's gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth. It also mandates that school employees are not allowed to encourage any minor to keep their gender identity private rather than telling their legal guardians",

It mandates that no physician or health care professional shall be allowed to provide or prescribe treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill also specifically allows for \"corrective\" procedures for intersex traits. Other exceptions include physical injuries or illnesses. If a minor has been receiving a gender-affirming health care treatment prior to when this bill goes into effect, they may continue to receive this treatment only if their physician certifies in writing that ending the medical procedure would be harmful to the minor. In theses cases, no additional gender-affirming health care treatment may be provided, only continuation of the specific treatment they were already receiving. Minors may sue health care providers for violations of this bill and may sue their parents or guardians for consenting to any gender-affirming health care treatments on their behalf. Parents or guardians of minors may sue health care providers for violating this bill only if they did not consent to the treatments provided. The state's attorney general may also sue health care providers who violate this bill and require them to pay the state a penalty of $25,000 per violation. Violations are also subject to disciplinary action by the appropriate medical regulatory authority. If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect.",

    "Summary": "This bill amends the Education Code to regulate books that are sold to or included in public school libraries to exclude anything that contains \"sexually explicit material.\" It goes on to list definitions of \"sexually explicit material\" that include written material, photographs, video files, audio files or communication that describes sexual conduct in a \"patently offensive way.\" It directs the State Library and Archive Commission to implement standards for school libraries that prohibit \"sexually explicit\"  material from being included. This bill makes a distinction between books that are \"sexually explicit\" and \"sexually relevant.\" Access to library materials that are deemed \"sexually relevant\" to required curriculum would need written parental approval. This bill requires school book vendors to rate books based on sexual content and prohibits them from selling any books containing material that is deemed \"sexually explicit\" in content. Vendors are instructed to submit a list to the Texas Education Agency of all books sold to school districts containing sexual content. Books not rated by the vendors may be reviewed by the Agency. If they are deemed \"sexually relevant\" or \"sexually explicit,\" the Agency requires vendors to rate them and/or recall all copies previously sold to a school district. Book vendors who are in violation of these rules will be listed on the Agency's website and school districts will not be allowed to order books from them. This bill also instructs schools to review \"sexually relevant\" content every 5 years to determine if the material will be retained. Additionally, school districts are required to submit a list of all books deemed \"sexually relevant\" that were added to the catalog during the preceding school year. ",

    "Summary": "This bill prohibits businesses from allowing \"sexually oriented performances\" in the presence of a minor, making them a Class A misdemeanor. \"Sexually oriented performance\" includes nudity, sexual conduct, or\n\"appeals to the prurient interest in sex.\" \"Sexual conduct\" is defined as actual or simulated sex; genital contact; contact with buttocks or breast; a device designed and marketed for sexual stimulation, or \"sexual gesticulations using accessories or prosthetics that exaggerate male or female sexual characteristics\". The performer does not need to be paid for it to be considered a crime. Finally, the bill does not require that a minor is actually present, but that the performance takes place on public property when a where a child could be \"reasonably\" expected to be around. If a performance occurs on private property, a minor must be present, and with a subsequent penalty of $10,000 maximum per infraction, as well as potential civil or state (by the attorney general) legal action.

This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill specifically allows an exception for \"corrective\" procedures for intersex traits. Violations are considered unprofessional conduct by a medical professional and subject to disciplinary action. This bill also prevents public funds from being given to any organization that provides trans health care to minors in any capacity, and it prevents health insurance companies from paying for trans health care treatments for any minor. It also declares that all money paid to or used for anyone's gender transition may not be tax deductible.  If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect.",

This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill specifically allows an exception for \"corrective\" procedures for intersex traits. The bill allows continuation of care for minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria before the effective date of the bill, but the provider must obtain a transgender treatment certification to be established by the state and can only prescribe hormonal treatments including puberty blockers after having treated the patient for gender dysphoria for at least six months, considered other possible diagnoses and treatments, and disclosed potential side effects and long-term consequences of the treatment as specified in the bill, among other hurdles. Violations are considered unprofessional conduct. Health care providers who do not comply with the provisions in this bill can be sued for malpractice, and minors who consent to hormonal treatment beginning after the effective date of the bill can dis-affirm consent up to the age of 25.

    "Summary": "This bill was initial a bills addressing social media site tactics that intentionally create addictive behaviors in minors, however it has been amended at the last moment to include a more direct online censorship component. This bill requires commercial entities that publish material considered \"harmful to minors\" (people under 18) to verify that anyone accessing their site is 18 or older. This requirement would apply if more than one-third of the website's content falls into this category. Material is considered \"harmful to minors\" if the average person would consider that it appeals to a prurient interest and if it is devoted to or principally consists of descriptions of real, simulated, or animated sexual acts or nudity, and if it lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. This could be used to apply to queer and trans content. The commercial entities and any third-party verification services are prohibited from retaining the personal information they collect when verifying users. Violations of this law make the entity liable for damages. News-gathering organizations and public-interest broadcasts are exempt from this law. If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect.",

    "Summary": "This bill was initially a bill centered on student mental health. However, it has been amended to add several anti-trans bills and is now an omnibus bill with many desperate components. It includes a book ban, a teaching restriction, a bathroom ban, and a sports ban.\nThe first section requires schools to report all books that a student checks out from the school library to their parents, if their parents opt to receive said email notifications. \nThis bill also prohibits school libraries from keeping material that is considered \"harmful to minors\" within their collection. Material is considered \"harmful to minors\" if the average person would consider that it appeals to a prurient interest and if it is devoted to or principally consists of descriptions of real, simulated, or animated sexual acts or nudity, and if it lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. This could be used to apply to queer and trans content.\nNext, this bills bans all sex education from grades k-6, removes the requirement for public schools to have to teach sex ed. It also requires any school's potential sex ed curriculum to be reviewed by the local school board and by all parents. All hearings reviewing this curriculum must be made open to the public and 45 days must be given for public comment. Parents must give written permission before a student is allowed to be taught, and may remove their child at any time. \nFurthermore, it also requires that parents are able to view all records a school has on their child, including previously excepted school counselor records. This could result in the outing of students.\nNext, this bill prohibits people from entering bathrooms and changing rooms that do not correspond to their sex assigned at birth within schools. In this bill, \"sex\" is defined by the person's genitalia/birth certificate.\nFinally, this bill directs public schools to explicitly ban trans female students from school sports. It bans students whose \"sex\" is male from participating in sports teams designated for females, women, or girls. Students can sue the educational institution with claims they were harmed or lost opportunity as a result of a violation of this bill.",

The bill allows some sexually explicit materials to be included in restricted materials, but only to the extent necessary to satisfy standards established by the state board of education, or to implement curricula required for advanced placement, international baccalaureate, or dual enrollment coursework. Restricted materials may not be available to students in grades 6 and below. Students in grades 7 and up may only access these materials with written consent from their parent or guardian. The bill also states that obscenity in any medium in instructional materials and school library materials is not protected under the Georgia Constitution or the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. School districts are allowed to exclude materials that are \"pervasively vulgar\" or \"educationally unsuitable\" from instructional materials and school libraries. Primary instructional material purchased from vendors must have a rating provided by the vendor which indicates if any portion of the material is sexually explicit. Every June, each school district must post on its website a list of all primary instructional materials used in the previous year that had sexually explicit content. The bill also states that moving forward, no school library may acquire sexually explicit material or material harmful to minors. Each year, local school boards must review the contents of restricted sections and decide which materials will continue to be available and which will be removed. Finally, the bill provides that when parents make a complaint alleging that material harmful to minors is being made available to students, the material in question must be made inaccessible to students until the complaint is resolved.",

    "Summary": "This bill categorizes all medical care done for transition purposes for minors (under the age of 18) as \"genital mutilation\" and declares that anyone who facilitates such procedures is guilty of a felony. In this bill, \"genital mutilation\" includes surgeries on genitals or reproductive organs, puberty blockers, and hormone replacement therapy. It bans anyone from providing or knowingly giving permission for transition-related treatments to patients under 18. It also declares that moving a child to another state to facilitate getting transition-related medical treatments is a felony. The bill specifically allows for \"corrective\" procedures for intersex traits. Other exceptions include labor or pregnancy-related operations or if the procedure is necessary to the child's health. According to this bill, gender affirmation cannot constitute a reason why a treatment would be deemed medically necessary. If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect.",

School libraries are required to provide a method for selection of library materials and ensure a complete inventory of materials are available to parents and legal guardians of students enrolled at the school. The local education agency board of trustees will establish a library materials review committee to review formal requests for reconsideration of selected school library materials and procedures on an annual basis. Any school employee, student, or parent/guardian of a student may make a formal request for reconsideration of library materials, and challenged materials will be pulled from circulation during the reconsideration request. The school librarian or other designee will submit a report to the library materials review committee within 21 days describing the material subject to the request along with its relationship to library materials selection policy. Within 45 days, the committee shall discuss the request and then come to a decision by a majority vote. The requester may appeal the decision within 5 business days, after which the board of trustees shall review the findings and provide a final decision. If a school does not comply with these provisions, the school library will be closed to students until the school is in compliance. ",

    "Summary": "This bill requires large social media sites create a way for third party monitoring software to have access to all minors accounts. Said software would then be accessible by the parents and would report to the parent on an incredibly broad series of possible things. It would report if the minor is at \"foreseeable risk\" for many things, including the obvious like self harm and violence, but also including exposure to \"harmful materials\" and potential academice dishonesty or sharing of any personal information including their phone number. The monitering software would also give parents considerable control of the minor's socail media account, and allow them to control all online interactions through the social media site. \"Harmful Materials\" here applies if the average person would consider that it appeals to a prurient interest and if it is devoted to or principally consists of descriptions of real, simulated, or animated sexual acts or nudity, and if it lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. This could be used to apply to queer and trans content. Additionally, the third-party montering software services are prohibited from retaining the personal information they collect, and the large social media companies would not be held liable for any potential damages caused by sharing this information. Violations of this bill would be enforced by the Attorney General as an unlawful business practice. This Act takes effect June 1, 2025.",

It bans students whose \"biological sex\" is male from participating in sports teams designated for females, women, or girls. In contrast, there are no restrictions on who may participate in sports teams designated for males, men, or boys. According to this bill, \"biological sex\" is to be defined by a birth certificate issued at or near the time of the student's birth. The requirements in this bill apply to interscholastic athletic programs or any athletic programs operated by public universities or community colleges. Furthermore, the rule that a student's sex should be defined by their birth certificate as issued at or near the time of their birth also applies to K-12 interscholastic athletic programs and all athletic programs supported by school district funds.",

It would also add rules requiring teachers to be \"non-partisan\", along with other restrictions in what can be taught. These restrictions, although not explicitly restricting the ability for teachers to educate on topics such as racism, transphobia, homophobia, etc, would be prohibitive. Additionally it would require teachers to upload/make available a list of all materials used in their classes before the school year. When requested by parents, they would be required to provide all materials within 5 days for inspection. Finally, there is a process to allow parents to complain about materials being used not complying with the restrictions listed in this bill, resulting in books and materials being removed from curriculums.

A parent may bring suit against a governmental agency for violations of this law, and may invoke this law as a defense in a judicial or administrative hearing brought by a governmental or private entity. If a child does not have the right to access specific medical treatment, this law does not give the parents the right to access the treatment on the child's behalf.",

School personnel are required to encourage students to discuss issues relating to their health and well-being with their parents. School policies may not prevent parents from accessing their child's health and education records maintained by the school or records created or used by a community mental health center or provider. At the beginning of each school year, school districts must notify parents of all health care services offered to students and allow the option to withhold consent or decline any specific service. For students in kindergarten through 12th grade, if a school district wishes to administer a health questionnaire, screening, survey, etc., the district must show the questionnaire, etc., to parents and get their consent beforehand. The school may not provide students with individualized behavioral instruction or services for mental or physical health issues identified by such a questionnaire without permission from the parents. This bill also prohibits classroom discussions about sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through 12th grade, or \"in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students.\" The bill also requires the school corporation to notify parents if their school allows a student to use a multi-occupancy restroom or changing area \"that is designated for a sex that is not the student's biological sex.\" School districts must have procedures for parents to notify schools of any concerns they have, and if their concerns are not resolved, they may sue the school district.",

An exception is made for emancipated children as well as if the school employee believes that there is a risk of abuse upon guardians learning of a possible transgender identity. Parents must have access to all educational and health records maintained by the school that pertain to their child and be able to remove their child from classes at will, with active notification of any classes pertaining to sexuality and gender identity. Furthermore, this bill prohibits classroom instruction on gender identity and sexual activity from kindergarten to grade three. This bill removes the requirement to teach about HIV in grades 1 through 12 and HPV and the available vaccine in grades 7 through 12. Lastly, this bill requires that a list of books removed from a school library or classroom must be made available to parents and that a child may not access a book at school without the written consent of their parent or legal guardian.",

    "Summary": "This bill has many different sections restricting the ability of minors (under the age of 18) to transition in various ways. The bill bans all medical care, including mental health care, done for transition purposes for minors. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy, as well as social transition support, including affirming a minor's chosen name and pronouns, method of dress, and \"sex-role specific behaviors that vary from those behaviors typically associated with the person's sex.\" The bill specifically allows for \"corrective\" procedures for intersex traits. Violations are considered unprofessional conduct by a medical professional and subject to disciplinary action, loss of license, and loss of any public funding. Health care providers who provide transition-related services to a minor must report the procedure within 30 days or they will be guilty of a misdemeanor, or a felony for multiple repeated offenses. Providers may also be sued by the patient, or by their legal guardian while they are a minor. This bill also prevents public funds from being used to provide gender-affirming care to minors, and it prevents Medicaid and any health insurance issued to public employees from paying for gender-affirming treatment for any minor. Other insurers who cover transition care for minors are liable for damages sustained as a result of that care and can be sued by the patient or their guardian. Public school counselors and other public employees are prohibited from aiding in the provision of gender-affirming care to a minor, and makes them liable for any injury resulting from such care. The ban includes encouraging them to consider gender-affirming care, except to the extent allowed by the First Amendment and Kentucky Constitution. Furthermore, the bill requires schools to inform the parents of a minor student if the student's gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth, or if the student has asked to change their name or pronouns, unless the school believes that the student is the victim of physical, sexual, or substance abuse by a parent and believes that disclosing the student's gender identity would subject them to further abuse. In that situation the school is still required to out the student to their other parent. The bill also prohibits any changes to a minor's birth certificate or changes to their legal name if the purpose is to help them transition. It also requires that minors detained in the juvenile justice system be classified according to their sex assigned at birth.",

Schools would not be allowed to make policies to prevent deadnaming or misgendering of students, and would be required to out students to their parents. Schools would also be required to provide descriptions of all mental health services and allow parents to opt their children out. \nAdditionally, schools must gain written permission from parents or legal guardians before teaching students about sex, sexuality, gender, or other \"controversial\" topics such as racism or politics. They must also give all materials related to classes addressing such subjects to parents for review in advance. If a parent complains, the school has 60 days to \"fix\" their compliance before being open to being sued for damages. \nFor the purposes of this bill, drag is considered obscene and harmful to minors, thus not to be shown. Drag is defined such to include any performance including someone who is gender non-conforming or not presenting matching their \"biological sex\" (defined by their birth certificate).\nIf any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect.",

This bill prohibits state employees, except for law enforcement, from withholding information related to a child's physical, emotional or mental health from their parent and prohibits them from  encouraging children to withhold information from their parents. \nFor educational involvement, the bill requires schools to allow parents to review all curriculum, clubs, and extracurricular activities offered by the school. Notably, schools are required to obtain written parental consent before providing any instruction related to gender or sexuality. Additionally, parents are required to provide written consent before their child uses a name or nickname other than their legal name and before their child uses a pronoun that does not align with their sex. Even if parental consent is given, no person can be required to use pronouns for a student that do not align with the student's sex. Parents are given the right to withdraw their child from any instruction or activity that they view as \"harmful.\" \nThis bill requires parents to give consent for all of their child's medical and mental health care, except in emergency situations. Notably the bill states that if a child does not have the right to access a particular medical or mental health service this bill does not give the parent the right to access that care for their child. This means that parental rights cannot be used to override a ban on gender-affirming care. Parents may sue for any violations of this act. \nThis bill also amends an existing bill to allow parents to exempt their child from any teaching related to reproductive health or any disease, including HIV/AIDS.",

    "Summary": "This bill combines several different policies. Firstly, it allows guardians to veto any transgender treatment of a minor in their care. Secondly, it requires any government agent (or iterations thereupon) from encouraging a minor to withhold their gender identity from their guardians, and requires said agents to inform any relevant guardians if a minor shows any signs of being in any way conflicted about their gender. \nAdditionally, the bill makes it illegal to provide trans care for a minor, including counseling, HRT, and surgery. It also provides protection for whistleblowers who report those that violate these rules, allows for judicial relief of \"damages\", and makes the bill both preempt any local policies that might contradict this law, as well as allowing the rest of the bill to remain law even if any given section is found to be illegal. \nNotable: this bill defines a minor as anyone under the age of 21, not 18",

    "Summary": "This bill establishes a \"parents' bill of rights\" that guarantees parents or legal guardians the right to direct and make decisions regarding their child's education, upbringing, religious training, and healthcare. The bill requires school districts to guarantee a legal guardian's right to be involved in their child's education and health. The bill requires parental consent before performing, arranging for, prescribing, or even providing a child a referral for a medical exam, surgery, medication, or a mental health evaluation. Legal guardians must have access to all educational and health records maintained by the school that pertain to their child and be able to remove their child from classes, clubs, and extracurricular activities at will, with at least five days active notification of any classes pertaining to sexuality and gender identity. The bill requires parental consent before a child can use a name or pronoun other than their legal name or sex assigned at birth, but does not require use of the name or pronoun that aligns with the child's gender identity. Furthermore, this bill requires any public or charter school employee to inform the legal guardians of a minor if that minor's gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth. It also mandates that school employees are not allowed to encourage any minor to keep their gender identity private rather than telling their legal guardians. Parents who sue and are successful can recover not only legal and attorneys fees but also $5,000 per violation.",

It is important to note here that neither HRT nor puberty blockers sterilize, especially not permanently. They can reduce fertility, perhaps even significantly, but not consistently and once a patient has stopped taking such medication their fertility will frequently return to previous levels.",

The bill requires that each medical school attest to the state board that the institution does not require applicants to subscribe to \"DEI ideologies\" (or discriminate against applicants who do not), does not require admitted students to study \"DEI ideologies\"; this list will be published by the state board of registration. The bill defines diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as efforts to promote racial diversity; references to differences between people on the basis of groups like culture, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religion, or sexual orientation; and policies or practices around previously-mentioned group differences, though there is a caveat that DEI does not include federal or state discrimination information. The bill requires all medical schools to publish titles and syllabi for all coursework and training in a public, online database, and prohibits medical schools from conducting DEI audits or other DEI engagement. The bill would also require applicants to medical school \"to complete a standardized admissions test focused on knowledge and critical thinking with respect to science and medical training,\" and medical schools in the state must additionally submit standards to the state if the school wishes to change admission processes and assessments. In addition, the bill prohibits healthcare licensing boards from adopting any licensing incentives for participating in DEI training, as well as prohibits these licensing boards from using any DEI material as part of the certification process; these licensing boards are also prohibited from conducting DEI audits. The bill would also require any state entity that is applying for federal funding for a healthcare DEI grant to publish all their materials and any information related to the application on a public website. Further, any healthcare provider with more than 50 employees and all medical schools must submit an annual statement that claims the institution is in compliance with the provisions in the \"Do No Harm Act.\" If any of these conditions are violated, a member of the public can file a claim against the medical school or healthcare provider for relief, damages of at least $100,000, compensation, and legal fees.",

    "Summary": "This bill amends an existing bill to ban and criminalize drag performance. This bill adds drag queens and drag queen story hours to the existing definition of \"adult cabaret performances.\" The bill defines a drag queen as \"a male or female performer who adopts a flamboyant or parodic feminine persona with glamorous or exaggerated costumes and makeup,\" which can in practice be construed to include trans women presenting as women when children are present. It also has provisions that would withhold funding from the entire district if any school hosts a drag queen story hour or if an employee is found to violate this bill, which would in practice mean queer and gender non-conforming people being banned from jobs in education if they present in a way that aligns with their gender identity.",

This law would apply to businesses with at least 10 full-time employees. A government entity may make an exception to this requirement if it determines that the requirement is inconsistent with the entity's constitutional or statutory duties in the management of funds or debt obligations, or if it would prevent the entity from obtaining goods or services in an economically practical manner. Any party that attempts to penalize a financial institution for complying with this law will be considered to have caused harm to the state.

    "Summary": "This bill has several components. The primary focus is in requiring social media websites to implement age verification protocols for state residents, after which they would be required to lock the accounts of minors from 10:30 pm to 6:30 local time. It also would require parental permission for all accounts held by minors in the state. The second section for relevance is as follows. This bill requires commercial entities that publish material considered \"harmful to minors\" (people under 18) to verify that anyone accessing their site is 18 or older. This requirement would apply if more than one-third of the website's content falls into this category. Material is considered \"harmful to minors\" if the average person would consider that it appeals to a prurient interest and if it is devoted to or principally consists of descriptions of real, simulated, or animated sexual acts or nudity, and if it lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. This could be used to apply to queer and trans content. The commercial entities and any third-party verification services are prohibited from retaining the personal information they collect when verifying users. Violations of this law make the entity liable for damages. News-gathering organizations and public-interest broadcasts are exempt from this law.",

First, it bans any \"divisive concepts\" from public school curricula or instruction. The \"divisive concepts\" listed in the bill include unconscious bias, racial privilege, and any topics that might cause students to feel \"discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex.\" This bill also creates a \"Parents' Bill of Rights\", which states that parents or guardians of a child attending a public school in Missouri have the right to participate in and direct the education of their child and to know what is being taught in the child's school. Public school employees are not allowed to encourage minors to withhold any information from their parents. Parents can also opt their child out of any instructional content that they disagree with, and they can opt out of any health measures not required by state order or statute. Schools must make all curricula available to parents at least 30 days before the start of a semester, including textbook titles, reading lists, and course outlines. This bill also bans athletes whose \"biological sex\" is male from participating in female, women, or girls sports. According to this bill, \"biological sex\" is to be defined by chromosomes, sex hormones, gonads, and non-ambiguous genitalia present at birth. This requirement applies to public and private middle schools, high schools, and postsecondary institutions.",

The bill requires school districts to guarantee a parent's right to be involved in their child's education and health.  Parents must have access to all educational and health records maintained by the school that pertain to their child and be able to remove their child from classes at will, with active permission require for any classes pertaining to sexuality and gender identity.  Furthermore, this bill requires any public or private school employee to inform the legal guardians of a minor if that minor's gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth. It also mandates that school employees are not allowed to encourage any minor to keep their gender identity private rather than telling their legal guardians. ",

Finally, the bill requires schools to define sports teams as for \"males, men or boys\"; \"females, women, or girls\"; or \"coed or mixed.\" Trans students are effectively prohibited from playing on an appropriate team. The only way a \"biological female\" student may play on a \"male\" sports team is if there is no \"female team available\"; \"biological male\" students are banned from playing on a \"female team.\" A student--or school--who believes this was violated can bring a lawsuit against the school, and may receive damages and court fees.

    "Progress": "House Committee",
    "Summary": "This bill has three main sections. The first section bans all medical care done for transition purposes for minors (under the age of 18). It mandates that no one shall be allowed to provide or prescribe treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill also specifically allows for \"corrective\" procedures for intersex traits. Violations by medical providers would subject them to discipline by their disciplinary board. The bill also prohibits the use of public funds for gender transition care and prevents insurance from covering it. Individuals may bring claims for violations of this act. The second section is about public schools. This section affirms that parents have a fundamental right to direct the education of their children and to teach them about \"matters of faith, morals, and matters relating to their sexuality.\" The bill requires public schools to refer to students according to their birth name and pronouns, and forbids them to teach about different pronouns besides male and female ones. In kindergarten through 8th grade, schools are forbidden to teach that there are more than two genders or that gender \"is a choice, optional or fluid.\" In grades 9 and up, these concepts can only be taught in a course taught by a licensed child psychologist and only in the context of teaching about gender dysphoria. Before any class teaching that there are more than two genders, parents must be notified and can opt out their child; the child can also opt themself out. This part of the bill also requires that any extracurricular activities that are separated by gender can only allow students to participate in the group corresponding to their \"biological sex as listed at their time of birth.\" In addition, restrooms are required to be single-gender, and students are required to use the one corresponding to their \"biological sex.\" Violators will be disciplined and may lose their license and job. Students and parents can bring claims for damages and legal fees for violations of the act. The third section concerns the definition of conversion therapy and creates exceptions for certain counseling situations, as long as the counseling doesn't seek to change the person's gender identity or sexual orientation \"against their clearly expressed will.\"",

    "Summary": "This bill prohibits material considered \"harmful to minors\" (people under 18) from public schools, and prohibits employees and contractors from assisting minors with access such materials. Material is considered \"harmful to minors\" if the average person would consider that it appeals to a prurient interest and if it is devoted to or principally consists of descriptions of real, simulated, or animated sexual acts or nudity, and if it lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. This could be used to apply to queer and trans content. Schools would be required to enact a protocol for parents to complain about any given material, and would be obligated to review and respond within 10 days. Parents may appeal any decisions made to the board of education and failure to comply would open up schools/districts to civil liability for damages, which would be at minimum 1000$ per violation. ",

    "Summary": "This bill establishes a \"parents' bill of rights\" that guarantees parents the right to direct and make decisions regarding their child's education, upbringing, religious training, and healthcare. The bill requires school districts to guarantee a parent's right to be involved in their child's education. For example, parents must be able to inspect all curricula, syllabi, activities, exams, books, and other learning materials that will be used in their child's classes. Parents must also have access to all educational and health records maintained by the school that pertain to their child. Parents may also challenge the material or educational benefit of any book, magazine or any other material in the school library, with a successful challenge resulting in the removal of that material from the school. To facilitate parental review of educational materials, each school district must establish an internet-based transparency tool titled the \"parent transparency portal\". Furthermore, this bill also makes it illegal for any person with supervision of a commercial or public establishment to display or provide any material with nudity or sexual content to minors.",

In addition, anyone who removes or permits the removal of a minor to another state to receive the treatment is guilty of a class A felony. This is still prohibited if the minor or their guardians consented to the treatment, and there are no exceptions for custom, ritual, or religious practice. The bill does allow exceptions for procedures that are necessary to the physical health of the minor and procedures performed as part of the minor's delivery of a child. Any child who receives the prohibited treatments will be considered an abused child.",

    "Summary": "This bill has two major parts. First, this bill would increase the liability for any medical practitioner who provides or prescribes treatments to patients for any transition-related care. This includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. Patients can sue for any potential or perceived damages within 3 years of starting their Detransition, not within 3 years of their initial treatment. This can cause many providers to refuse service due to the open ended and long term risk to their practice. The second section of this bill is a Trans Erasure bill, changing two definitions within the State Commission for Human Rights. It redefines gender identity first, removing several terms, including  replacing \"assigned sex at birth\" with \"sex\". It then adds \"sex\" and defines it as being \"biological\" and distinct from gender identity. It does not clarify how sex is to be determined. ",

    "Summary": "This bill creates a \"Parents' bill of rights in education.\" The bill states that \"parents have a fundamental right and responsibility to direct the upbringing, education, and care\" of minors in their care, and therefore schools cannot withhold information about children from parents. The bill gives the parent rights to review any educational curricula material of their child, the right to exempt their child from immunizations (either with a physician's approval or because of religious beliefs), the right to be notified before any non-academic survey is issued to their child, and more. The bill also states that parents have the right to be notified if their child uses a different name \"a reasonable person would understand to be for the purpose of facilitating a change of gender or gender transition.\" The bill would give parents the right to ask and be informed about if a child is being affirmed as a gender different than the gender the child was enrolled in school with. Finally, the bill gives parents the right to be told by the school what activities, organizations, and related groups their child is participating in.",

    "Summary": "This bill has two major parts. First, this bill would increase the liability for any medical practitioner who provides or prescribes treatments to patients for any transition-related care. This includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. Patients can sue for any potential or perceived damages within 3 years of starting their Detransition, not within 3 years of their initial treatment. This can cause many providers to refuse service due to the open ended and long term risk to their practice. The second section of this bill is a Trans Erasure bill, changing two definitions within the State Commission for Human Rights. It redefines gender identity first, removing several terms, including  replacing \"assigned sex at birth\" with \"sex\". It then adds \"sex\" and defines it as being \"biological\" and distinct from gender identity. It does not clarify how sex is to be determined. ",

    "Summary": "This bill requires that an investment manager, fiduciary, or board of trustees of a public retirement system must make and supervise investments of the reserve fund solely in the financial interest of participants and beneficiaries. A fiduciary (a person acting on behalf of the state or local retirement system board as an investment manager or proxy advisor) may only take financial factors into account when acting on behalf of a public retirement system, and all shares held by or on behalf of a public retirement system and/or the participants and their beneficiaries must be voted solely in the financial interest of participants and their beneficiaries. Financial interest, as defined in the bill, cannot involve furthering social, political, or ideological goals, which consist of a variety of listed actions, including facilitating \"access to abortion, sex or gender change or transgender surgery.\" Also, unless there is no financially practicable alternative, if a public retirement account grants proxy voting authority to a person who is not a member, or entrusts assets to a fiduciary, or follows the recommendations of a proxy advisor or other service provider, that person, fiduciary, or advisor must make a written commitment to act solely on financial considerations. A company that serves as a fiduciary and violates these provisions must pay damages to the state equal to three times the amount paid to the company for its services by the public retirement system.",

Violations are considered unprofessional conduct by a medical professional and subject to disciplinary action. Violators may also be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000. This bill also prevents public funds from being given to any organization that provides trans health care to minors in any capacity, and it prevents health insurance companies from paying for trans health care treatments for any minor. Furthermore, this bill requires government agents to inform the legal guardians of a minor under its care or supervision if that minor's gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth. It also mandates that school employees are not allowed to encourage any minor to keep their gender identity private rather than telling their legal guardians. The parents of minors who received gender affirming care may sue the provider for up to two years after services received, and an adult who received gender affirming care as a minor may sue for damages at any time for 20 years after turning 18. This bill also includes vague laws prohibiting the distribution of \"obscene materials\" to minors and requiring that electronic devices should have the ability to automatically prevent materials that are \"obscene to minors\" from being accessed or downloaded by minors when activated within the state.",

    "Summary": "This bill seeks to restrict gender-affirming clinical care to minors. The bill defines \"\"biological sex\"\" by chromosomes, genitalia, and normally produced hormone levels. The bill would effectively prohibit healthcare providers from providing gender transition-related healthcare to a minor, as it adds six additional requirements to seeking transition-related care, including parental consent from two parents, two clinicians signing off that a minor would benefit from transition-related care, six months of psychiatric counseling before any care is given, and a requirement of ongoing psychiatric care until the minor reaches 18. All appointments must be in-person and cannot be telehealth. It would also prevent the referral of patients to other providers. The bill would prohibit any public funds from being used to any organization or individual that provides gender transition-related care to a minor. The bill additionally requires the state to create a standardized consent form, which must be signed 30 days before the first appointment and at every appointment thereafter, that claims that in Sweden, Finland, and the UK, authorities have determined clinical intervention to be bad for trans youth, and that psychiatric care should instead be used. If someone has clinical transition-related care while under 18, they may seek injunctive relief, damages, and/or attorneys' fees; the claim must be filed within 15 years after minor reaches or would have reached 18. There is an explicit exemption for intersex youth. Notably, much of the requirements for minors to receive trans-affirming care is already part of the WPATH Standards of Care.",

It keeps the progress of the previous version, while being entirely different. This bill prohibits people from entering bathrooms and changing rooms that do not correspond to their sex assigned at birth in correctional facilities. In this bill, \"sex\" is defined by the person's capacity to produce sperm or ova or could theoretically have had such a capacity. In practice this would be determined using their sex assigned at birth. It additionally prohibits the Department of Corrections or county jails/etc from assigning inmates to the same housing area with opposite assigned sex at birth. ",

    "Summary": "This bill, called \"School Establishment Clause Act\" classifies gender identity and sexual orientation as religious beliefs. The bill uses this classification as justification to ban schools from creating or endorsing policies that respect, endorse, favor, or promote gender identity or sexual orientation. This bans students from participating in sports and from using locker rooms and restrooms designated for a different \"biological sex.\" The bill also prohibits schools from mandating the use of pronouns that are not aligned with \"biological sex\". Schools are not allowed to teach students anything related to gender identity or sexuality unless it is part of a sex education program for which parents have been informed that the teaching could \"expose their child to licentiousness and one particular religious worldview\" and given written consent. Finally, schools are banned from hosting \"drag queen story time\" events which are defined as \"inherently sexualized performances targeting minors''. The bill determines \"biological sex\" by anatomy at birth and chromosomes. In the case of a \"dispute\" over a student's \"biological sex\", students must present a doctor's note that states their sex based only on their internal and external anatomy, \"normal, endogenously produced\" testosterone levels, and an analysis of their \"genetic makeup\". This bill applies to pre-k to twelfth grade public and accredited private schools. Taxpayers, parents, and school employees can sue a school for violations of this policy. School employees who violate this policy can be fired immediately. This bill prohibits schools from discriminating against a person for \"failing to believe'' in gender identity or sexuality, and students and teachers can sue for discrimination if it occurs. The bill declares an emergency for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety and states that the state will be \"particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance\" of this bill. If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal or invalid, the rest of the bill remains in effect. ",

If someone cannot or does not want to use a restroom that conforms to the sex listed on their original birth certificate, the person can use a single-occupancy facility, but cannot be allowed to use the appropriate facility. If a school district does not comply with this law, it will be referred to the attorney general, and principals or other school employees who are found to have violated the law may be fined a maximum of $1,000. The bill also states that students on overnight trips must be housed either with students of the same sex or in individual sleeping quarters, unless they are being housed with immediate family members. Parents can sue the school district if their child is housed with people of a different gender, or if their child encounters a student of a different gender in a restroom or changing room who was given permission to be there by a school principal or superintendent, or if the school district is found to be noncompliant with the provisions of this law.",

This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill also specifically allows for \"corrective\" procedures for intersex traits. Violations are considered felonies and can carry prison sentences up to 20 years. Furthermore, this bill requires any public or private school employee to inform the legal guardians of a minor if that minor's gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth. It also mandates that school employees are not allowed to encourage any minor to keep their gender identity private rather than telling their legal guardians. If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect.",

If a student's birth certificate was not issues at or near the date of birth, then that student will have to provide \"other evidence indicating the student's sex\". This bill does not explain what \"other evidence\" would be deemed acceptable. The requirements in this bill apply to public institutions of higher education and private institutions of higher education whose students or teams compete against public institutions of higher education. Students can sue the educational institution if they can claim they were harmed or lost some opportunity as a result of violations of this bill.",

    "Summary": "This bill requires schools to classify all of their sports as being for \"males, men, or boys\", \"females, women, or girls\", or \"coed or mixed\". It bans students whose \"biological sex\" is male from participating in sports teams designated for females, women, or girls. Students whose \"biological sex\" is female may only participate in a sports team designated for males, men, or boys if a corresponding team for females, women, or girls is not offered. According to this bill, \"biological sex\" is to be determined by the student's birth certificate issued at or near the time of birth or corrected due to a clerical error. In the absence of a birth certificate, another government record that states the student's sex may be used. The requirements in this bill apply to K-12 education and higher education and to public schools, charter schools, and private schools that compete against public schools. Students can sue the educational institution if they can claim they were harmed or lost some opportunity as a result of violations of this bill.",

It mandates that no physician or other health care professional shall be allowed to provide or refer treatments to patients under 26 for any transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill also specifically allows for \"corrective\" procedures for intersex traits. Other exceptions include injuries, illness, or when there is an imminent danger of death without treatment. Violations are considered a state jail felony. A medical professional who violates these provisions is also subject to disciplinary action by their professional regulatory agency and loss of license or certification. This bill also prevents public funds from being given to anyone who provides trans health care to people under 26, and it prevents Medicaid from reimbursing trans health care treatments for people under 26. An individual who received transition-related care when under the age of 26 may sue for damages. The statute of limitations for criminal liability is 40 years. For civil liability, it is 40 years from the time the patient turns 18.",

Any material that is judged to be \"sensitive material\" must be reported to the state board, where the state board will either ratify the schools decision or reject it. If the state board ratifies, the material must be removed from all schools (public and charter) within the state. If rejected, the school may still ban the material. This bill also requires the state board to review and adopt a rating system for the state to use regarding what is classified as \"sensitive material\".

    "Summary": "This bill would prohibit funding or support of diversity, equity, and inclusion offices or officers in higher education. DEI is defined to include any attempt to educate or include marginalized identities, and herein is given extremely broad definitions that would have far reaching implications. A DEI officer includes an employee of an institution of higher education (including contractors) who, as at least part of their duties, coordinate, create, implement, or promote polices or programs around DEI. This bill includes caveats for offices that provide advice on federal or state discrimination law, or offices composed entirely of lawyers and paralegals. The definition of \"DEI officer\" also includes a caveat for faculty members' research and teaching, lawyers, or guest speakers. Any funding that has been already allocated towards DEI work can be reallocated towards scholarships for low-/middle-income students, or reducing tuition for in-state students. Finally, in the 2024 fiscal year, an institution of higher education cannot spend any funding until its board of trustees files a statement that discloses how the institution complies with this bill, the number of job titles that fell under \"DEI officer,\" and an attestation that the institution complies with the law; this report must also be made available to the public. If this bill is violated, any person can notify the state attorney general, though only a current student, current faculty member, or alumni of the institution can initiate a legal claim. ",

The bill does not define \"substantial portion.\" \"Material harmful to minors\" means any description or representation of nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sadomasochistic abuse that appeals to the prurient interest of minors, that is offensive according to prevailing standards of what is suitable for minors, and that lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. This could be used to apply to queer and trans content. Violations of this law make the entity liable for damages and attorney's fees.",

It also prohibits these institutions from maintaining a DEI office or hiring an employee or third party to perform the duties of a DEI office. This bill additionally requires that schools adhere to a series of tenets, primarily aimed around rejecting the concept of systemic racism and bigotry, including queer and transphobia. The bill also states that no employee of the aforementioned entities may be required to use a pronoun for a student that is \"inconsistent with the student's biological sex\" and defines biological sex as \"an individual's physical form as a male or female based solely on the individual's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\"",

    "Summary": "This bill establishes a \"parents' bill of rights\" that guarantees parents the right to direct and make decisions regarding their child's education, upbringing, religious training, and healthcare. The bill requires school districts to guarantee a parent's right to be involved in their child's education and health. Parents must have access to all educational and health records maintained by the school that pertain to their child and be able to remove their child from classes at will, with active notification of any classes pertaining to sexuality and gender identity or other \"controversial subjects\". Furthermore, this bill reserves the rights of the parents to determine the pronouns and name a student uses in school. It also mandates that school employees are to report changes in a student's gender expression and presentation to parents. If any section of this bill is declared illegal or invalid, all other sections of the bill will remain in effect.",

    "Summary": "This bill is an attempt to codify the definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" in the state's general statutes. It says that a person's sex is determined by their reproductive system or chromosomes and that sex is determined at birth. The bill defines a female/woman/girl as someone with XX chromosomes and/or the reproductive organs to produce an egg, and a male/man/boy as someone with XY chromosomes and/or the reproductive organs to fertilize an egg. \"Mother\" is defined as a female parent, and \"father\" as a male parent. The bill also states that laws, rules, and regulations that distinguish between the sexes are subject to \"intermediate constitutional scrutiny,\" which forbids unfair discrimination between the sexes but allows the law to distinguish between them if there's an important governmental objective. The law states that enforcing distinctions between the sexes in several areas including athletics, prisons, domestic violence shelters, and public restrooms serves the important governmental objective of protecting people's safety and privacy. The law also states that person born with a \"disorder or difference in sex development\" must be given legal protections and accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act and applicable Wyoming laws. The law mandates that schools and government agencies that collect vital statistics for complying with anti discrimination laws or for gathering accurate public health, crime, economic, or other data must identify each person in the data set as either male or female consistent with their assigned sex at birth.

    "Summary": "This bill directs public, private and charter schools and universities which compete against public schools to classify all interscholastic competitive sports teams as being for \"males, men, or boys\", \"females, women, or girls\", or \"coed or mixed\". It bans students whose \"biological sex\" is male from participating in sports teams designated for females, women, or girls. According to this bill, \"biological sex\" is defined by the student's chromosomes and anatomy at birth. Students can sue the educational institution with claims they were harmed or lost some athletic opportunity as a result of a violation of this bill. If the above policy banning participation based on sex is found to be invalid or otherwise prohibited by the court, the following back-up policy for determining eligibility in sports will take effect. The back-up policy gives the state board of education the power to determine the eligibility of students to participate in \"gender-designated\" sports that do not match the sex on their birth certificate.  The bill outlines the policies that athletic associations, students, parents and the state board of education should follow. Notably the board is responsible for \"reviewing evidence\" submitted by the student and their parents, including the \"student's physical characteristics or medical treatments.\" The state board of education is charged with determining if the student's gender identity \"is consistent\" with the definition of gender identity provided in the DSM-5. Students are required to prove that their gender identity is valid by sharing their medical history and other \"evidence\" that their gender identity is a \"sincerely held\" part of their identity. In addition to making judgments about a student's gender, the bill states that the board should consider the student's age, gender, height, weight, and other relevant physical characteristics. The board is allowed to request \"additional evidence\" from the student. The bill also states that the board should consider if the student's participation in the sport would be a safety risk or give the student an unfair advantage. The board is allowed to consult with mental health professionals, sports physiologists, coaches and athletic directors during the process, but the board alone is responsible for making decisions about eligibility to compete in sports. The bill grants board members immunity from lawsuits related to their eligibility decisions.",

    "Summary": "This bill prohibits classroom discussions about sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. For grades four and above, discussions cannot occur \"in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students.\" The bill also requires schools to notify parents of any change in services or monitoring relating to a student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being. School district personnel are further required to encourage all students to discuss issues relating to their well-being with their parents. At the beginning of each school year, school districts must notify parents of all health care services offered to students and allow the option to withhold consent or decline any specific service. For students in kindergarten through third grade, if a school district wishes to administer a health questionnaire or screening, the district must show the questionnaire or screening to parents and get their consent beforehand.
