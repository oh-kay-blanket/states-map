AL HB4,Active,House Committee,"This bill prohibits school and public libraries from keeping material that is considered ""harmful to minors"" within their collection. Material is considered ""harmful to minors"" if the average person would consider that it appeals to a prurient interest and if it is devoted to or principally consists of descriptions of real, simulated, or animated sexual acts or nudity, and if it lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. This could be extended to apply to queer and trans content. Additionally, a clause is added to the definition of ""sexual conduct"" that defines any ""knowing expos[ure]"" to ""sexual or gender oriented conduct"" alongside language typically used to refer to Drag performances. Thus, the bill is significantly expanding what is not allowed in K-12 public schools and libraries. It then proceeds to remove the existing immunity to criminal prosecution for public schools/libraries under obscenity laws, even when acting on behalf of genuine educational purpose, should they fail to remove the content fast enough. Specifically, if a parent has provided written notice asking for the removal of something from the collection, it must be removed/relocated within 15-25 days (depending on circumstance). Violations of this law make the entity liable for potential criminal charges, damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.",Alabama,https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/HB4/2025,2/4/2025,,Arnold Mooney,"Book Ban,Educational Censorship",,

The bill will also require any gender clinic to provide statistical data which will be available of the state's website on all gender affirming treatment it provides.

FL S0254,Passed,Passed,"This bill also establishes that a court of the state Florida will gain temporary emergency jurisdiction for a child if the parents or legal guardians are letting them receive health care for transition purposes, allowing them to potentially remove them from the parents care. This Bill specifies it would apply to any child ""present"" in the state, so visiting families would also possibly be targeted by this bill. Transition related health care for people above 18 requires documented informed and voluntary consent, something already the medical standard. 

This bill also bans all medical care done for transition purposes for minors (under the age of 18). It mandates that no physician or other health care professional shall be allowed to provide, prescribe, or refer treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill also specifically allows for ""corrective"" procedures for intersex traits. Other exceptions include injuries, illness, or when there is an imminent danger of death without treatment and exceptions can be made for minors that have begun transition-related treatment before this bill went into effect. Violations are considered a first degree misdemeanor.

Notably, this bill would also prevent anyone who is not a licensed physician from being allowed to proscribe gender affirming care for trans adults. This would thus prevent Nurse Practitioners and Physicians Assistants from proscribing care, drastically impacting the amount of adults who are able to get care. This applies to all adults in the state, regardless of age or residency. 

This bill mandates that no health care professional shall be allowed to provide or prescribe treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care or refer minor patients to other providers for transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill specifically allows an exception for ""corrective"" procedures for intersex traits. Violations are considered unprofessional conduct by a medical professional and subject to disciplinary action. This bill also prevents public funds from being given to any organization that provides trans health care to minors in any capacity, and it prevents health insurance companies from paying for trans health care treatments for any minor. It also declares that all money paid to or used for anyone’s gender transition may not be tax deductible.  If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect.

IA SF418,Passed,Passed,"This bill is an attempt to codify the definitions of ""male"" and ""female"" in the state's general statutes. It is the first successful rollback of gender identity as a protected class from a state that had previously enshrined protections based on gender identity. It does this by literally striking Gender Identity from Iowa Civil Rights Law.
Additionally, this bill states that a person's sex is determined by their reproductive role and capacity to produce sperm or ova or their theoretical capacity to do so, and that sex is determined at birth and cannot be changed. The bill defines a ""female"" as someone with the reproductive organs to produce an egg and a ""male"" as someone with the reproductive organs to produce sperm. It also defined gender as being solely a synonym for ""sex"" and that all references to gender must use the above definition. The bill continues to say that this definition is to be used to discriminate against trans people in all state laws and policies, including documentation. This bill requires birth certificates/records to have a ""sex"" at birth designation that is either male or female, with non-binary designations being banned.

KY SB150,Passed,Passed,"This bill was Heavily amended, read full summary for details.

This bill initially expands parental authority over their child by requiring that all medical records and all school records must be made available to the parents or legal guardians of a minor (under 18). Schools would not be allowed to make policies to prevent deadnaming or misgendering of students, and would be required to out students to their parents. Schools would also be required to provide descriptions of all mental health services and allow parents to opt their children out. Additionally, schools must gain written permission from parents or legal guardians before teaching students about sex, sexuality, or gender, and give all materials related to classes addressing such subjects to parents for review 14 days in advance.

This bill was heavily amended last minute in several key ways. First, it prevents teaching about sexuality, gender expression, or gender identity through grades 8, and allows from 9-12 only in extremely limited and approved classes. Any teacher or presenter may not refer to their own gender identity nor sexual orientation, except if that identity is cisgendered and heterosexual. No class may teach in any way about racism, homophobia, transphobia, or any aspect of oppression/bigotry. Any discussion of ""controversial subject matter"" is disallowed, with explicit banning of discussions on non-cisgendered and non-heterosexual positions.

This bill also bans the showing of nudity and ""obscene"" materials within public schools, defining these in such a way to likely remove most health textbooks, as well as depictions of PRIDE and queer people in general. 

Another section would ban students from using bathrooms based on anything but their birth certificate. The phrasing suggests schools to develop such policies to ""protect privacy"". 

Finally, this bill bans all medical care done for transition purposes for minors (under the age of 18). It mandates that no physician or other health care professional shall be allowed to provide, prescribe, or refer treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill also specifically allows for ""corrective"" procedures for intersex traits. Violations are considered unprofessional conduct by a medical professional and subject to disciplinary action.

First, this bill is an attempt to codify the definitions of ""male"" and ""female"" in the state's general statutes. It states that a person's sex is determined by their capacity to produce sperm or ova or their theoretical capacity to do so, and that sex is determined at birth and cannot be changed. The bill defines a woman as someone with the reproductive organs to produce an egg  and a man as someone with the reproductive organs to produce sperm. It then applies this definition to any and all state statutes.
This bill requires any public building with a bathroom or changing room to have bathrooms and changing facilities designated for exclusive use by females and males along with unisex facilities. The bill also prohibits people from entering bathrooms and changing rooms that do not correspond to their sex assigned at birth in any public building, except for in several predetermined instances: when accompanying a person of the opposite sex to assist them or when chaperoning a child under age 12; for law enforcement or governmental regulatory purposes; when providing emergency medical assistance or intervening in an emergency situation; for custodial maintenance; or if the appropriately designated bathroom or changing facility is out of order and the restroom or changing facility designated for the opposite sex is free of any patrons. In this bill, ""sex"" is defined by the person's genitalia and genetics. If any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect.

NH HB1312,Passed,Passed,"This bill requires a school district or classroom teacher to provide parents with two weeks' notice of any curriculum course material used for instruction or a program about sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or gender expression. It also requires this for any program on human sexuality or sexual education (topics that were already required to be disclosed if used for instruction but not for a program). No notice is required for a school employee answering a question from a student during class. The bill also removes the phrase ""To the extent practicable"" from a requirement that a school district make curriculum course materials available to parents on request. The bill also prohibits schools from adopting policies preventing school district personnel from notifying a parent about their child's mental, emotional, or physical health or sexuality. School policies also may not encourage a student to withhold this kind of information from their parents, and school employees may not discourage or prohibit parental notification and involvement in decisions affecting their child's mental, emotional, or physical health, except when there is reason to believe that parental notification will put a student at risk of abuse, neglect, or abandonment.",New Hampshire,https://legiscan.com/NH/bill/HB1312/2024,7/19/2024,,"Kristine Perez, Ron Dunn, Dan Innis, Louise Andrus, David C.

GA HB1104,Failed,Final vote,"This bill was initially a bill centered on student mental health. However, it has been amended to add several anti-trans bills and is now an omnibus bill with many desperate components. It includes a book ban, a teaching restriction, a bathroom ban, and a sports ban.
The first section requires schools to report all books that a student checks out from the school library to their parents, if their parents opt to receive said email notifications. 
This bill also prohibits school libraries from keeping material that is considered ""harmful to minors"" within their collection. Material is considered ""harmful to minors"" if the average person would consider that it appeals to a prurient interest and if it is devoted to or principally consists of descriptions of real, simulated, or animated sexual acts or nudity, and if it lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific interest to minors. This could be used to apply to queer and trans content.
Next, this bills bans all sex education from grades k-6, removes the requirement for public schools to have to teach sex ed. It also requires any school's potential sex ed curriculum to be reviewed by the local school board and by all parents. All hearings reviewing this curriculum must be made open to the public and 45 days must be given for public comment. Parents must give written permission before a student is allowed to be taught, and may remove their child at any time. 
Furthermore, it also requires that parents are able to view all records a school has on their child, including previously excepted school counselor records. This could result in the outing of students.
Next, this bill prohibits people from entering bathrooms and changing rooms that do not correspond to their sex assigned at birth within schools. In this bill, ""sex"" is defined by the person's genitalia/birth certificate.
Finally, this bill directs public schools to explicitly ban trans female students from school sports. It bans students whose ""sex"" is male from participating in sports teams designated for females, women, or girls.

The ban includes encouraging them to consider gender-affirming care, except to the extent allowed by the First Amendment and Kentucky Constitution. Furthermore, the bill requires schools to inform the parents of a minor student if the student’s gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth, or if the student has asked to change their name or pronouns, unless the school believes that the student is the victim of physical, sexual, or substance abuse by a parent and believes that disclosing the student's gender identity would subject them to further abuse. In that situation the school is still required to out the student to their other parent. The bill also prohibits any changes to a minor's birth certificate or changes to their legal name if the purpose is to help them transition.

NH HB619,Failed,House Committee,"This bill has three main sections. The first section bans all medical care done for transition purposes for minors (under the age of 18). It mandates that no one shall be allowed to provide or prescribe treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill also specifically allows for ""corrective"" procedures for intersex traits. Violations by medical providers would subject them to discipline by their disciplinary board. The bill also prohibits the use of public funds for gender transition care and prevents insurance from covering it. Individuals may bring claims for violations of this act. The second section is about public schools. This section affirms that parents have a fundamental right to direct the education of their children and to teach them about ""matters of faith, morals, and matters relating to their sexuality."" The bill requires public schools to refer to students according to their birth name and pronouns, and forbids them to teach about different pronouns besides male and female ones. In kindergarten through 8th grade, schools are forbidden to teach that there are more than two genders or that gender ""is a choice, optional or fluid."" In grades 9 and up, these concepts can only be taught in a course taught by a licensed child psychologist and only in the context of teaching about gender dysphoria. Before any class teaching that there are more than two genders, parents must be notified and can opt out their child; the child can also opt themself out. This part of the bill also requires that any extracurricular activities that are separated by gender can only allow students to participate in the group corresponding to their ""biological sex as listed at their time of birth."" In addition, restrooms are required to be single-gender, and students are required to use the one corresponding to their ""biological sex."" Violators will be disciplined and may lose their license and job. Students and parents can bring claims for damages and legal fees for violations of the act. The third section concerns the definition of conversion therapy and creates exceptions for certain counseling situations, as long as the counseling doesn't seek to change the person's gender identity or sexual orientation ""against their clearly expressed will.""",New Hampshire,https://legiscan.com/NH/bill/HB619/2023,5/24/2023,,"Nikki McCarter, Jeanine Notter, Sheila Seidel, Alicia Lekas, James A.

NH HB1431,Failed,To Governor,"This bill establishes a “parents’ bill of rights” that guarantees parents the right to direct and make decisions regarding their child’s education, upbringing, religious training, and healthcare. The bill requires school districts to guarantee a parent's right to be involved in their child's education. For example, parents must be able to inspect all curricula, syllabi, activities, exams, books, and other learning materials that will be used in their child’s classes. Parents must also have access to all educational and health records maintained by the school that pertain to their child. Parents may also challenge the material or educational benefit of any book, magazine or any other material in the school library, with a successful challenge resulting in the removal of that material from the school. To facilitate parental review of educational materials, each school district must establish an internet-based transparency tool titled the “parent transparency portal”. Furthermore, this bill also makes it illegal for any person with supervision of a commercial or public establishment to display or provide any material with nudity or sexual content to minors.",New Hampshire,https://legiscan.com/NH/bill/HB1431/2022,5/26/2022,,"Paul Terry, Jeffrey Greeson, John M.

NH HB1664,Failed,House Floor,"This bill has two major parts. First, this bill would increase the liability for any medical practitioner who provides or prescribes treatments to patients for any transition-related care. This includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. Patients can sue for any potential or perceived damages within 3 years of starting their Detransition, not within 3 years of their initial treatment. This can cause many providers to refuse service due to the open ended and long term risk to their practice. The second section of this bill is a Trans Erasure bill, changing two definitions within the State Commission for Human Rights. It redefines gender identity first, removing several terms, including  replacing ""assigned sex at birth"" with ""sex"". It then adds ""sex"" and defines it as being ""biological"" and distinct from gender identity. It does not clarify how sex is to be determined.

NH SB304 ,Failed,Senate Floor,"This bill has two major parts. First, this bill would increase the liability for any medical practitioner who provides or prescribes treatments to patients for any transition-related care. This includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. Patients can sue for any potential or perceived damages within 3 years of starting their Detransition, not within 3 years of their initial treatment. This can cause many providers to refuse service due to the open ended and long term risk to their practice. The second section of this bill is a Trans Erasure bill, changing two definitions within the State Commission for Human Rights. It redefines gender identity first, removing several terms, including  replacing ""assigned sex at birth"" with ""sex"".

The bill adds the following as definitions of child abuse to the current text:
Consenting to, supplying, administering or assisting the administration or supply of prescription puberty suppressants or cross-sex hormones to a child for the purpose of transitioning or gender reassignment - exception is made for intersex children
Consenting to or performing surgery or another medical procedure on a child, other than an intersex child, for the purpose of transitioning or gender reassignment

It bans students whose ""biological sex"" is male from participating in sports teams designated for females, women, or girls. According to this bill, “biological sex” is defined by the student's chromosomes and anatomy at birth. Students can sue the educational institution with claims they were harmed or lost some athletic opportunity as a result of a violation of this bill. If the above policy banning participation based on sex is found to be invalid or otherwise prohibited by the court, the following back-up policy for determining eligibility in sports will take effect. The back-up policy gives the state board of education the power to determine the eligibility of students to participate in ""gender-designated"" sports that do not match the sex on their birth certificate.  The bill outlines the policies that athletic associations, students, parents and the state board of education should follow. Notably the board is responsible for ""reviewing evidence"" submitted by the student and their parents, including the ""student's physical characteristics or medical treatments."" The state board of education is charged with determining if the student's gender identity ""is consistent"" with the definition of gender identity provided in the DSM-5. Students are required to prove that their gender identity is valid by sharing their medical history and other ""evidence"" that their gender identity is a ""sincerely held"" part of their identity. In addition to making judgments about a student's gender, the bill states that the board should consider the student's age, gender, height, weight, and other relevant physical characteristics. The board is allowed to request ""additional evidence"" from the student.
