US HB28,Negative Bill,Active,Crossed over,"This is a direct amendment to Title IX. This bill directs all schools that receive Federal funding to classify all sports teams and athletic programs/activities as being for ""males, men, or boys”, ""females, women, or girls”. It bans students whose ""biological sex"" is male from participating in sports teams designated for females, women, or girls. According to this bill, “biological sex” is defined by a persons reproductive biology and genetics at birth. Given essentially nobody has a genetic test done at birth, in practice this means the basis would be entirely on what sex a person was assigned at birth. Students can sue the educational institution with claims they were harmed or lost some athletic opportunity as a result of a violation of this bill. Additionally it calls for a study to be done to document all complaints made against trans students in girls sports, to be submitted to congress.
