Along with this care, the insurance provider must also produce statistical reporting on the number of detransition-related care services it covers. Next, the bill requires a new, expedited process to allow an individual to revert back to their deadname. This requires the state to maintain a record of original birth certifiates in order to quickly allow the individual to revert back.

It is the first successful rollback of gender identity as a protected class from a state that had previously enshrined protections based on gender identity. It does this by literally striking Gender Identity from Iowa Civil Rights Law.\\nAdditionally, this bill states that a person's sex is determined by their reproductive role and capacity to produce sperm or ova or their theoretical capacity to do so, and that sex is determined at birth and cannot be changed. The bill defines a \\"female\\" as someone with the reproductive organs to produce an egg and a \\"male\\" as someone with the reproductive organs to produce sperm. It also defined gender as being solely a synonym for \\"sex\\" and that all references to gender must use the above definition. The bill continues to say that this definition is to be used to discriminate against trans people in all state laws and policies, including documentation. This bill requires birth certificates/records to have a \\"sex\\" at birth designation that is either male or female, with non-binary designations being banned. Finally, modifies existing educational bans on teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation, calling gender identity gender \\"theory\\"\\nIf any given section of this bill is found to be illegal, the rest of the bill remains in effect.","State":"Iowa","Bill Information Link":"https://legiscan.com/IA/bill/SF418/2025","Last Activity Date":"2/28/2025","Representatives to Contact":"","Sponsors":"Jason Schultz","Category":"Trans Erasure,Documents,Bathrooms","Yea Votes":"","Nay Votes":""},{"\uFEFFCase Name":"IA SF482","Status":"Passed","Progress":"Passed","Summary":"This bill would prohibit students from using single or multiple toilet facilities in elementary or secondary schools that \\"do not correspond with the person's biological sex.\\" The bill defines \\"sex\\" as \\"the biological designation of female or male on a person's birth certificate, characterized by reproductive anatomy and chromosomes.\\" If \\"a citizen of the state,\\"  whether affiliated with the school or not, believes a school violates this, they may file a complaint with the state attorney general.","State":"Iowa","Bill Information Link":"https://legiscan.com/IA/bill/SF482/2023","Last Activity Date":"3/22/2023","Representatives to Contact":"","Sponsors":"Jeff Taylor, K.

This bill also requires the parents or legal guardians to be notified if an employee of the school has reason to believe a student identifies with a gender different from their gender assigned at birth and written consent is necessary to address a student with a name and pronoun not aligning with their birth certificate. An exception is made for emancipated children as well as if the school employee believes that there is a risk of abuse upon learning of the possible transgender identity. Parents must have access to all educational and health records maintained by the school that pertain to their child and be able to remove their child from classes at will, with active notification of any classes pertaining to sexuality and gender identity. Furthermore, this bill prohibits classroom instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation from kindergarten to grade six. This bill removes the requirement to teach about AIDS in grades 1 through 12 and HPV and the available vaccine in grades 7 through 12. Lastly, school library programs may only contain \\"age-appropriate\\" materials that support the curriculum achievement goals.

Schools would not be allowed to make policies to prevent deadnaming or misgendering of students, and would be required to out students to their parents. Schools would also be required to provide descriptions of all mental health services and allow parents to opt their children out. Additionally, schools must gain written permission from parents or legal guardians before teaching students about sex, sexuality, or gender, and give all materials related to classes addressing such subjects to parents for review 14 days in advance.\\n\\nThis bill was heavily amended last minute in several key ways. First, it prevents teaching about sexuality, gender expression, or gender identity through grades 8, and allows from 9-12 only in extremely limited and approved classes. Any teacher or presenter may not refer to their own gender identity nor sexual orientation, except if that identity is cisgendered and heterosexual. No class may teach in any way about racism, homophobia, transphobia, or any aspect of oppression/bigotry. Any discussion of \\"controversial subject matter\\" is disallowed, with explicit banning of discussions on non-cisgendered and non-heterosexual positions.\\n\\nThis bill also bans the showing of nudity and \\"obscene\\" materials within public schools, defining these in such a way to likely remove most health textbooks, as well as depictions of PRIDE and queer people in general. \\n\\nAnother section would ban students from using bathrooms based on anything but their birth certificate. The phrasing suggests schools to develop such policies to \\"protect privacy\\". \\n\\nFinally, this bill bans all medical care done for transition purposes for minors (under the age of 18). It mandates that no physician or other health care professional shall be allowed to provide, prescribe, or refer treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill also specifically allows for \\"corrective\\" procedures for intersex traits. Violations are considered unprofessional conduct by a medical professional and subject to disciplinary action.

It then applies this definition to any and all state statutes.\\nThis bill requires any public building with a bathroom or changing room to have bathrooms and changing facilities designated for exclusive use by females and males along with unisex facilities. The bill also prohibits people from entering bathrooms and changing rooms that do not correspond to their sex assigned at birth in any public building, except for in several predetermined instances: when accompanying a person of the opposite sex to assist them or when chaperoning a child under age 12; for law enforcement or governmental regulatory purposes; when providing emergency medical assistance or intervening in an emergency situation; for custodial maintenance; or if the appropriately designated bathroom or changing facility is out of order and the restroom or changing facility designated for the opposite sex is free of any patrons.

Health care providers who do not comply with the provisions in this bill can be sued for malpractice, and minors who consent to hormonal treatment beginning after the effective date of the bill can dis-affirm consent up to the age of 25. The bill also orders a systematic medical evidence review overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services to make recommendations for the legislature to consider when deciding whether to lift the moratorium on gender-affirming care for minors.","State":"Utah","Bill Information Link":"https://legiscan.com/UT/bill/SB0016/2023","Last Activity Date":"1/27/2023","Representatives to Contact":"","Sponsors":"Katy Hall, Michael S.

It also requires any school's potential sex ed curriculum to be reviewed by the local school board and by all parents. All hearings reviewing this curriculum must be made open to the public and 45 days must be given for public comment. Parents must give written permission before a student is allowed to be taught, and may remove their child at any time. \\nFurthermore, it also requires that parents are able to view all records a school has on their child, including previously excepted school counselor records.

The bill bans all medical care, including mental health care, done for transition purposes for minors. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy, as well as social transition support, including affirming a minor's chosen name and pronouns, method of dress, and \\"sex-role specific behaviors that vary from those behaviors typically associated with the person's sex.\\" The bill specifically allows for \\"corrective\\" procedures for intersex traits. Violations are considered unprofessional conduct by a medical professional and subject to disciplinary action, loss of license, and loss of any public funding. Health care providers who provide transition-related services to a minor must report the procedure within 30 days or they will be guilty of a misdemeanor, or a felony for multiple repeated offenses. Providers may also be sued by the patient, or by their legal guardian while they are a minor. This bill also prevents public funds from being used to provide gender-affirming care to minors, and it prevents Medicaid and any health insurance issued to public employees from paying for gender-affirming treatment for any minor. Other insurers who cover transition care for minors are liable for damages sustained as a result of that care and can be sued by the patient or their guardian. Public school counselors and other public employees are prohibited from aiding in the provision of gender-affirming care to a minor, and makes them liable for any injury resulting from such care. The ban includes encouraging them to consider gender-affirming care, except to the extent allowed by the First Amendment and Kentucky Constitution. Furthermore, the bill requires schools to inform the parents of a minor student if the student's gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth, or if the student has asked to change their name or pronouns, unless the school believes that the student is the victim of physical, sexual, or substance abuse by a parent and believes that disclosing the student's gender identity would subject them to further abuse. In that situation the school is still required to out the student to their other parent. The bill also prohibits any changes to a minor's birth certificate or changes to their legal name if the purpose is to help them transition. It also requires that minors detained in the juvenile justice system be classified according to their sex assigned at birth.","State":"Kentucky","Bill Information Link":"https://legiscan.com/KY/bill/HB470/2023","Last Activity Date":"3/14/2023","Representatives to Contact":"","Sponsors":"Jennifer Decker, James Tipton, Shane Baker, John Blanton, Steve Bratcher, Randy Bridges, Josh Calloway, Ryan Dotson, Daniel Elliott, Daniel Fister, Patrick Flannery, Deanna Frazier Gordon, Chris Fugate, Jim Gooch Jr., Richard Heath, John Hodgson, DJ Johnson, Kim King, Matt Lockett, Candy Massaroni, Bobby McCool, Shawn McPherson, Amy Neighbors, Jason Petrie, Marianne Proctor, Steve Rawlings, Rebecca Raymer, Brandon Reed, Steven Rudy, Scott Sharp, Nancy Tate, Walker Thomas, Timmy Truett, Ken Upchurch, Russell Webber, Wade Williams","Category":"Health Care,Documents,Student Suppression","Yea Votes":"Kevin D.

The first section bans all medical care done for transition purposes for minors (under the age of 18). It mandates that no one shall be allowed to provide or prescribe treatments to patients under 18 for any transition-related care. This ban includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. The bill also specifically allows for \\"corrective\\" procedures for intersex traits. Violations by medical providers would subject them to discipline by their disciplinary board. The bill also prohibits the use of public funds for gender transition care and prevents insurance from covering it. Individuals may bring claims for violations of this act. The second section is about public schools. This section affirms that parents have a fundamental right to direct the education of their children and to teach them about \\"matters of faith, morals, and matters relating to their sexuality.\\" The bill requires public schools to refer to students according to their birth name and pronouns, and forbids them to teach about different pronouns besides male and female ones. In kindergarten through 8th grade, schools are forbidden to teach that there are more than two genders or that gender \\"is a choice, optional or fluid.\\" In grades 9 and up, these concepts can only be taught in a course taught by a licensed child psychologist and only in the context of teaching about gender dysphoria. Before any class teaching that there are more than two genders, parents must be notified and can opt out their child; the child can also opt themself out. This part of the bill also requires that any extracurricular activities that are separated by gender can only allow students to participate in the group corresponding to their \\"biological sex as listed at their time of birth.\\" In addition, restrooms are required to be single-gender, and students are required to use the one corresponding to their \\"biological sex.\\" Violators will be disciplined and may lose their license and job. Students and parents can bring claims for damages and legal fees for violations of the act. The third section concerns the definition of conversion therapy and creates exceptions for certain counseling situations, as long as the counseling doesn't seek to change the person's gender identity or sexual orientation \\"against their clearly expressed will.\\"","State":"New Hampshire","Bill Information Link":"https://legiscan.com/NH/bill/HB619/2023","Last Activity Date":"5/24/2023","Representatives to Contact":"","Sponsors":"Nikki McCarter, Jeanine Notter, Sheila Seidel, Alicia Lekas, James A.

The bill requires school districts to guarantee a parent's right to be involved in their child's education. For example, parents must be able to inspect all curricula, syllabi, activities, exams, books, and other learning materials that will be used in their child's classes. Parents must also have access to all educational and health records maintained by the school that pertain to their child. Parents may also challenge the material or educational benefit of any book, magazine or any other material in the school library, with a successful challenge resulting in the removal of that material from the school. To facilitate parental review of educational materials, each school district must establish an internet-based transparency tool titled the \\"parent transparency portal\\". Furthermore, this bill also makes it illegal for any person with supervision of a commercial or public establishment to display or provide any material with nudity or sexual content to minors.","State":"New Hampshire","Bill Information Link":"https://legiscan.com/NH/bill/HB1431/2022","Last Activity Date":"5/26/2022","Representatives to Contact":"","Sponsors":"Paul Terry, Jeffrey Greeson, John M.

This includes puberty blockers, surgeries, and hormone replacement therapy. Patients can sue for any potential or perceived damages within 3 years of starting their Detransition, not within 3 years of their initial treatment. This can cause many providers to refuse service due to the open ended and long term risk to their practice.

All appointments must be in-person and cannot be telehealth. It would also prevent the referral of patients to other providers. The bill would prohibit any public funds from being used to any organization or individual that provides gender transition-related care to a minor. The bill additionally requires the state to create a standardized consent form, which must be signed 30 days before the first appointment and at every appointment thereafter, that claims that in Sweden, Finland, and the UK, authorities have determined clinical intervention to be bad for trans youth, and that psychiatric care should instead be used.

It bans students whose \\"biological sex\\" is male from participating in sports teams designated for females, women, or girls. According to this bill, \\"biological sex\\" is defined by the student's chromosomes and anatomy at birth. Students can sue the educational institution with claims they were harmed or lost some athletic opportunity as a result of a violation of this bill. If the above policy banning participation based on sex is found to be invalid or otherwise prohibited by the court, the following back-up policy for determining eligibility in sports will take effect. The back-up policy gives the state board of education the power to determine the eligibility of students to participate in \\"gender-designated\\" sports that do not match the sex on their birth certificate.  The bill outlines the policies that athletic associations, students, parents and the state board of education should follow. Notably the board is responsible for \\"reviewing evidence\\" submitted by the student and their parents, including the \\"student's physical characteristics or medical treatments.\\" The state board of education is charged with determining if the student's gender identity \\"is consistent\\" with the definition of gender identity provided in the DSM-5. Students are required to prove that their gender identity is valid by sharing their medical history and other \\"evidence\\" that their gender identity is a \\"sincerely held\\" part of their identity. In addition to making judgments about a student's gender, the bill states that the board should consider the student's age, gender, height, weight, and other relevant physical characteristics. The board is allowed to request \\"additional evidence\\" from the student. The bill also states that the board should consider if the student's participation in the sport would be a safety risk or give the student an unfair advantage. The board is allowed to consult with mental health professionals, sports physiologists, coaches and athletic directors during the process, but the board alone is responsible for making decisions about eligibility to compete in sports. The bill grants board members immunity from lawsuits related to their eligibility decisions.","State":"Wyoming","Bill Information Link":"https://legiscan.com/WY/bill/HB0187/2023","Last Activity Date":"1/18/2023","Representatives to Contact":"","Sponsors":"Barry Crago, Ember Oakley, Clark Stith, Cyrus Western, Wendy Schuler","Category":"Sports","Yea Votes":"","Nay Votes":""},{"\uFEFFCase Name":"WY HB0190","Status":"Failed","Progress":"Introduced","Summary":"This bill states that for grades kindergarten through twelve, no school district may allow teachers or any other party to instruct students on sexual orientation or gender identity.
